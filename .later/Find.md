```

### Between min & max

## Execute when you find 
you can make find execute a command for every file/directory found.
**basic syntax**
```sh
find <path> <condition> -exec <command> {} \;
```
- `{}` means **replace** this with the **current file** you find 
- `\;` executes command **one time per file**
- `+` executes command **once for many files at once** (faster)


---
## Maxdepth 

Specify a maxdepth to limit the depth of the search :
```sh
find /path -maxdepth 2 -name "file"
```
**Remember to set the maxdepth as the first flag before the other patherns**

## Search by permissions

**Find executable files**
```sh
find . -type f -executable
```

**Find readable files for current user**
```sh
find . -type f -readable 
```

**Find files with a specific octal permissions**
```sh
find <path> -type f -perm 777
```

## Search by owner/group

**File owned by a user**
```sh
find /home -user kavali
```

**File owned by a group**
```sh
find / -group sudo
```
